What is Type Inference in TypeScript? Why is It Helpful?
TypeScript is a statically typed language that brings type safety to JavaScript. One of its most powerful and user-friendly features is type inference .
What is Type Inference?
Type inference is the ability of TypeScript to automatically determine the type of a variable based on the value assigned to it.
Why is It Helpful?
donâ€™t have to write explicit types every time, making your code cleaner and more concise.
Maintains Type Safety : Even without explicit annotations, TypeScript ensures variables are used consistently with the inferred type, preventing common runtime errors.



Provide an example of using union and intersection types in TypeScript
TypeScript provides advanced type systems that go beyond primitive types like string or number. Two powerful features are union types and intersection types , which allow you to combine types in flexible and meaningful ways. Union types let you specify that a value can be one of several types. Intersection types combine multiple types into one.
